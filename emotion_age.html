      <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Smily faces are usually evaulated as more friendly and attractive. Some studies showed that smiles also make faces look younger.
                                                     However, some suggest that smile-induced wrinkles makes faces look older. In this study, we aim to explore whether and how facial expressions impact face age estimates.
                                                     We used young, middle-aged and old face stimuli. For the older faces, since there are already obvious wrinkles on their facs, the smile-induced extra wrinkles are hypothesized not to have substantial effects.&nbsp;<br/></div>

      <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center;"><strong><font size="4.5">Methods</font></strong></div>
      <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is an online task, created using <a href="https://pavlovia.org/">Pavlovia</a> platform. One face was shown on the screen at a time, and participants need to estimate the age of the faces.
                                                      The independent variables are the age (young, middle-aged, old) and expressions (happy, angry, neutral) of the face stimuli, and the dependent variable is the participants' age estimate.
                                                      There is no time limit for the response. The link of the task was distributed through HKU mass email.&nbsp;<br/></div>

      <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center;"><strong><font size="4.5">Results</font></strong></div>
      <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">We collected data from 120 participants (18-60 years old). There is an interesting interaction between face age and face emotion.
                                                     To be more specific, both happy and angry look older than neutral faces, but this effect of facial expressions on age estimate only occur on young and middle-aged faces, but not older faces.
                                                     This finding supports the wrinkle account on effects of smiles on age perception.&nbsp;<br/></div>
