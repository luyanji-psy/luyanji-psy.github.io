      <h3>1. Multiple Face Processing</h3>
      <p>
          In this project, we explored cognitive mechanisms underlying multiple face processing.
          Previously, it has been found that summary statistics (e.g., mean or variance) can be extracted quite fast and precisely from multiple items presented simultanetously.
          We focus on high-level objects, namely faces here, and we have investigated:
          <ul>
              <li><a href="capacity.html">whether extracting average emotion was capacity unlimited or not</a></li>
              <li><a href="attention.html">whether average emotion could be perceived with limited attention</a></li>
              <li><a href="subsampling">how many faces in the set might be used in the averaging process</a></li>
              <li>what is the relatisonhip between individual and ensemble face perception</li>
              <li>whether we have insight to the averaging process</li>
          </ul>
          We are going to further explore eye movement patterns when observing multiple faces and the underlying neural mechanisms in future studies.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2. Holistic Face Processing</h3>
      <p>
          It is usually agreed that faces are processed holistically. However, there are still lots of debates how to define and measure "holistic".
          It has recently been found that different paradigms (e.g., inversion, composite task, part-whole) resulted in uncorrelated results.
          In this project, we aimed to:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="composite.html">investigate how and why different paradigms led to different "holistic effects"</a></li>
            <li>attempt to develop a unified framework for holisitc face processing</li>
            <li>explore the relationship of holistic processing for a single face and ensemble perception for multiple faces</li>                                                                      
          </ul>
      </p>
