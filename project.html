      <h3>1. Multiple Face Processing</h3>
      <p>
          In this project, we explored cognitive mechanisms underlying multiple face processing.
          Previously, it has been found that summary statistics (e.g., mean or variance) can be extracted quite fast and precisely from multiple items presented simultanetously.
          We focus on high-level objects, namely faces here, and we investigated:
          <ul>
              <li>whether extracting average emotion was capacity unlimited or not</li>
              <li>whether average emotion could be perceived with limited attention</li>
              <li>how many faces in the set might be used in the averaging process</li>
              <li>what is the relatisonhip between individual and ensemble face perception<li>
              <li>whether we have insight to the averaging process</li>
          </ul>
          We are going to further explore eye movement patterns when observing multiple faces and the underlying neural mechanisms in the future studies.
